# Health Impact Analysis of Environmental Pollutants

I recently completed a data visualization project focused on the impact of environmental pollutants on public health. Using Excel, I built an interactive dashboard to explore:

- Total and unresolved health cases  
- Distribution by region, pollutant type, and disease  
- Demographic breakdown (age group, gender, severity)  
- Disease trends over time  

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**.

## Skills Applied
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Pivot tables & dynamic visualizations  
- Dashboard design and insight communication  

## Why This Matters
Visualizing data like this gives us clearer insights into how pollution affects different communities â€” across geography, age, and exposure levels.

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback Welcome!
Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration. Feel free to explore, clone, and build upon this project!
